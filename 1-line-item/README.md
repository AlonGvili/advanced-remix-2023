- start with two fetchers, works great!
  - especially the 0 quantity thing "just works"
- slow network
  - this sucks!
  - add pending UI ... still sucks!
- optimistic UI
  - awesome!
  - what about the 0 case?
  - lol this sucks!
- PROBLEM: the conditional rendering doesn't know the optimistic values
- SOLUTION: move the fetcher up, pass it down
  - oh crap, race conditions on quantity vs. add
  - hard to cause, probably need to force it with backend setTimeouts
- just use a single fetcher, then state for both intents are shared
- keep total count in the header up to date
  - make it optimistic with useFetchers
  - embrace `let`!
